                        diversity existent in various ecosystems.Any material which is part of earth and satisfy human need and add value
                        is called as resource. Example: rocks, minerals, soil, rivers, plants &
                        animal. Human is a resource because developing his skill, he can develop other
                        resource by adding value to the physical material .
